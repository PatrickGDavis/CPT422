		<h1>Useful woodworking links</h1>
		
		<h2>Rockler</h2>
			<div class="img-container">
				<img src="images/rockler_logo.jpg" alt="Rockler logo">
			</div>
			<p>Rockler is a woodworking tool and hardware store with one of the widest selections on the web. I'm particularly fond of it's
			hardware selection. It has a wide variety of hinges, screws, and hardware kits. It also has wide tool selection, but it is primarily
			large, name brands, so they tend to be on the pricey side. As a hobbyist, I'm very cost aware, and will look for budget options for
			power tools especially on discount sites like <a class="inlineLink" href="http://www.harborfreight.com">Harbor Freight</a>, or  discount brand 
			<a class="inlineLink" href="http://www.amazon.com/Power-Tools-WEN-Hand/s?rh=n%3A551236%2Cp_89%3AWEN">Wen tools</a> on Amazon.</p>

		<h2>Lee valley tools</h2>
			<div class="img-container">
				<img src="images/lee_valley_logo.svg" alt="Lee valley logo">
			</div>
			<p>Another great aggregate site that has a wide selection of hand tools. When looking for a specific hand tool, this is a great place to go.
			Various inexpensive hand tools can be found on <a class="inlineLink" href="http://www.amazon.com"> Amazon</a> but the quality there varies widely. Knock off
			hand planes and the like are quite common, and many that are purchased are either unusable or require a lot of tuning to become decent. Lee Valley
			carries only high quality tools that are a joy to use. It's not a place to get starter planes, but if you get serious about hand tool woodworking,
			you'll want a couple great tools, and Lee valley has them. They are a licensed dealer for <a class="inlineLink" href="http://www.veritastools.com">Veritas tools</a> as well, the Lamborghini of
			hand tools, from planes to saws.</p>

		<h2>Benchcrafted</h2>
			<div class="img-container">
				<img src="images/benchcrafted_logo.png" alt="Benchcrafted logo">
			</div>
			<p>If you need a traditional woodworking bench, start here. They sell designs, but the real money maker here is the leg vise. There's a lot
			of information to be had on how to design and build a woodworking bench. I'm a fan of the Roubo style, though others prefer the english style
			or others, but almost all have some form of leg vise. They are one of the staple workholding tools on any bench, and the Benchcrafted leg vise
			is the best on the market. It uses a criss-cross to keep the chop parallel, eliminating the need to bend over and pin the traditional parallel guide.
			The high quality screw has an extremely easy and fast action, with a huge amount of gripping power. There are certainly cheaper options out there,
			but none better.</p>

			<p>Steve Ramsey is a <a class="inlineLink" href="http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBB7sYb14uBtk8UqSQYc9-w">Youtuber</a> with a sizeable following, and for good
			reason. He's <q>dedicated to the weekend worker who doesn't have an enormous shop space and a ton of expensive tools.</q> Unlike many of his peers,
			he makes videos from his small garage workshop. Many others tend to be professional woodworkers with expansive dedicated shops and tens of thousands
			of dollars in high end tools. Ramsey makes videos for hobbyists, and has instructions on his site for setting up a shop for under $1000, and a learning
			program called <a class="inlineLink" href="http://www.theweekendwoodworker.com/signup/">The Weekend Woodworker</a> that teaches students the basics of woodworking by building
			actual projects, rather than focusing on single skills.</p>
