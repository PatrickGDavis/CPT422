	<h2>About me</h2>
	
	<p1>
		I'm an electronic warfare technician out of Morris ANG base is Tucson, AZ. I joined at 22 after attending college for 
		a few years, majoring in computer science, with the intention of paying for my last year without having to take out any
		loans. Instead, I came to enjoy the work, as well as the stability of the pay and insurance. Now that I qualify for 
		tuition assistance, I'll finally be able to finish my degree without going into debt.

		Even more so than joining the military though, 15 year old me would be shocked to learn that I'm a family man. The idea
		repulsed me as a teen, but I've come to understand why so many of my peers dreamed of it. I've been with my wife for almost
		7 years now, married for close to 5. We've got 2 children, Tristan (2 rapidly closing in on 3) and Luka (1). The 3 of them
		have made every passing year the best one of my life. Even this one.

	<h3>I'm a woodworker!</h3>
	<p3>I like to build furniture in my garage whenever I can find the time, using mostly hand tools. I managed to get these ones
	done during the	pandemic:</p3>
