	<h2>About me</h2>
	
		<p>I'm an electronic warfare technician out of Morris ANG base is Tucson, AZ. I joined at 22 after attending college for 
		a few years, majoring in computer science, with the intention of paying for my last year without having to take out any
		loans. Instead, I came to enjoy the work, as well as the stability of the pay and insurance. Now that I qualify for 
		tuition assistance, I'll finally be able to finish my degree without going into debt.
		</p>
		<p>Even more so than joining the military though, 15 year old me would be shocked to learn that I'm a family man. The idea
		repulsed me as a teen, but I've come to understand why so many of my peers dreamed of it. I've been with my wife for almost
		7 years now, married for close to 5. We've got 2 children, Tristan (2 rapidly closing in on 3) and Luka (1). The 3 of them
		have made every passing year the best one of my life. Even this one.
		</p>
	
	<h2>I'm a woodworker!</h2>
		<p>I like to build furniture in my garage whenever I can find the time, using mostly hand tools. I managed to get these ones
		done during the	pandemic:</p>

			<li> Murphy bed <br> <img src="Murphy bed up.jpg" class="Projects" alt="Murphy bed up">
				<img src="Murphy bed down.jpg" class="Projects" alt="Murphy bed down"></li>
